<p>In 1891, at the age of twenty-one, Myra Albert traveled to New York to study at the Art Students League for the next three year. Her teachers
    included William Merritt Chase, who remained a life-long inspiration. Her talk on Chase, which she presented to interested groups in Seattle in the 1930s and 1940s,
    reflects her continuing admiration of him and his work many years after his death. Wiggins's descriptions of being a student in his classes and of
    his famed Tenth Street Studio, are particularly vivid.   </p>
