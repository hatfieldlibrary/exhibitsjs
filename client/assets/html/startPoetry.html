<p>In addition to establishing herself as a photographer and painter of note, Myra Wiggins was a successful poet who in the course of her lifetime wrote probably
    hundreds of short poems. Some of these were published as Christmas cards illustrated with her artwork, a number were published in magazines, and many were written as personal
    messages to friends and family members. Wigginsâ€™s poetry is traditional, rhyming verse on themes having to do with the beauty and nature, love of family, personal faith, and
    moral integrity.  </p>
