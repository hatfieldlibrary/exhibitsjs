<p>Donated to Willamette University in 1991, The Vernor Martin Sackett Negatives are a collection of over 800 black
and white negatives and glass slides.  They were taken by Vernor Martin Sackett, a young man living in Salem in the early
    twentieth century.  This collection of negatives documents campus life and student activities at Willamette University
    in the 1920s. Sacket, his future wife Mary Notson, his brother Sheldon Sackett and Sheldonâ€™s future wife Sadie Pratt
    are all featured.  Images also include trips Sackett made to various places in Oregon and Northern California as well
    as visits to family and friends.  In addition, there are images of Germany taken when Sackett spent time there while
    serving in the United States Army.  Next to his portrait in the Wallulah, the school yearbook, is the comment "He
owns a whole flock of cameras that won't eat anything but embarrassing situations. Sings a deep 'sonorous' bass, sells
pictures, trades kodaks, and goes to school in his spare time."</p>
