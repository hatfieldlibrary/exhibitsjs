<p>Myra Wiggins traveled extensively -- making the trip from Oregon to New York and back several times when she was a student as the Art Students League and in the
    early 1890s, taking extended trips abroad in 1900 and 1904, and touring the United States by train on numerous occasions later in life. Her husband Fred was a traveling
    salesman in his late career, and may of Myra’s later trips are recorded in her extensive correspondence to family and friends, for whom she describes her experiences,
    encounters, and adventures. Many of her letters are in the Wiggins collection in the Pacific Northwest Artists Archive, housed at the Mark O. Hatfield Library here at
    Willamette University. Presented here are excerpts from letters Wiggins wrote while on her trip to Jerusalem, in 1904, as a member of the World’s Fourth Sunday School
    Convention.</p>

<h3>1954</h3>
<p>In her 84th year, Myra Albert Wiggins experienced a career renaissance of sorts. Highlights from 1954 include an exhibit at the DeYoung Museum.</p>
