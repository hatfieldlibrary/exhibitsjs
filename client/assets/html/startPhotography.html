<p>Myra Wiggins, as unmarried Myra Albert, acquired her first camera in 1899 and taught herself to operate it and to develop and print the negatives. She was an
    accomplished amateur photographer, and while living in New York as a student at the Art Students League in the early 1890s, she joined the Camera Club of New York. There she
    met Alfred Stieglitz, who later named her to his elite photographerâ€™s group, the Photo-Secession. In Salem after her student days, Wiggins worked indefatigably at refining her
    photography: Between 1895 and 1910 she earned an international reputation for her carefully composed and beautifully illuminated studies of posed figures, still life subjects,
    and landscape. She was frequently mentioned in photographic press and on occasion contributed writings to the photo journals. Her most complete essay about her life in photography
    was written and published in the 1920s, by which time she had turned to painting as her primary creative pursuit. </p>
