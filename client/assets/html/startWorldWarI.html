<p> Vernor was in high school when the United States entered the war in 1917. He enlisted along with many of his
classmates from Sheridan, Oregon. His brother Leland was in Portland at the time and working for the Southern Pacific
Railroad. Leland was required to enlist because of his age, but Vernor didn't meet the age requirement for the draft,
which meant that he volunteered to fight on his own. It's unknown where Leland served, but based on the photographs,
    Vernor served in Germany. His photographs from the war depict him and other soldiers traveling along the Rhine, a
    river on the western side of Germany. Because of the censorship rules in place during the war, there are very few
    images of battles during the war, and Vernor's photographs are no exception. His photographs likely date to 1919, after
the war officially ended and the United States Army was participating in the disarmament of Germany.</p>
