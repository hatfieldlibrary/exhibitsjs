<p>…After a little, when the prices of camel rides had dropped, I bargained with a man to ride a few steps on his came and to have somebody take my picture, all for 5 cents.
    The first man I called to take my picture, (with my camera) aimed it at all points of the compass, and had me wildly waving my arms for 10 minutes, while the came driver
    was calling for double pay for taking his time, when the would-be camera man announced that he “couldn’t see a thing” and handed it over to his companion. No. 2 had
    never taken any pictures but No. 1 had; however, I begged No. 2, from my height in the broiling sun, to please aim it at me and snap it. He finally did, then brought it
    to me to turn up another film but I couldn’t’ do it, for No. 1 in his desperation had clinched it so tight that it would not work. Well, I fixed it with my hat pin, then
    utterly ignoring  No. 1 and No. 2 I called to a man who was passing with a large camera and tripod. Well, he capped the climax, for, although I shoed him where to press t
    he button, he baked off with the lens pointed directly up to the sky and tried to find me in the round lens of the finder, and I could not get him to turn it over, so I
    begged him – on my knees almost – to please bring me the camera, but even when he had turned it right side up, he “couldn’t see a thing.” So I told him to simply aim it
    and snap it, and he did; but it was almost the end of me. I was worn out. </p>
