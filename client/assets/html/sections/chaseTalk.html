<h3>A Talk by Myra Albert Wiggins</h3>
<p>(Excerpts from her hand-written script in the Pacific Northwest Artists Archive,
Hatfield Library, Willamette University)</p>

<p>Editor’s Note: In 1891, at the age of twenty-one, Myra Albert traveled to New York to study at the Art Students League for the next three years. Her teachers included William Merritt Chase, who remained a life-long inspiration.  Her talk on Chase, which she presented to interested groups in Seattle in the 1930s and 1940s, reflects her continuing admiration of him and his work many years after his death.  Wiggins’s descriptions, highlighted below, of being a student in his classes and of his famed Tenth Street Studio, are particularly vivid.</p>

<p>William Merritt Chase, the great American painter and
teacher, art patron and collector, was born in Williamsburg,
Franklin County, Indiana, on November 1, 1849,
and died at his home in New York City on October 25, 1916,
at the age of 67.</p>

<p>At that time The New York Sun said:
“The death of William Merritt Chase on
Wednesday night ended a long and honorable career. For
40 years or more he has been foremost among American
artists, as man, as painter and as teacher . . . .”</p>

<p>The New York Times editorial said:
“The rich variety of his product, his indisputable
mastery of the medium he employed, inevitably seemed
to him the homage of his own generation.” </p>

<p>The Oregonian editorial said:
“It probably is not saying too much to assert
that Chase was the foremost American artist at the time of
his death, and his work as a teacher and as a lecturer
especially was a noteworthy influence, the importance
of which it would be difficult to over-estimate.”</p>

<p>A writer in the Seattle Times of recent date says:
“Perhaps no other man of his time exerted so great
an influence on the development of taste and
art appreciation in American as did William Chase.”
I quote from these four great Eastern and Western
newspapers in order to fix in our minds the really
national character of this truly great man. And not truly
in America was his influence felt but also on many
countries abroad where he studied for seven or eight years as a
young student – and returning many times thereafter for the study
of the great masters in the Galleries of Europe. In his study
while a student he made many copies of old Masters especially of his favorites,
Franz Hals, Velazquez, Rembrandt, Titian, Holbein and others. He did this to study
technique and color . . . . </p>

<p>For many years he held his summer classes abroad in England, Italy,
Belgium, Holland, and Spain – returning a number of times
to many of these countries – and he always fitted out a studio of his
own in each place – and Chase’s studios surpassed all
others since he was a born collector of antiques and
beautiful objects and furniture. It seemed to be necessary
for him to be surrounded by these things in order to
do his best work. </p>

<p>When he was just a boy he showed remarkable
talent – which his father, a shoe merchant deemed
a useless one – for as a clerk in his father’s store
William wasted far too much wrapping paper in learning
to draw. The father in despair finally took the boy to
an artist to ask his advice and received the frank
statement that William would never make an artist.
Time passed and the father again took his son
(who was the oldest of seven children) to another artist, Benjamin Hayes, who
realized after seeing some of William’s work that the boy
had talent and gladly took him as a pupil. Young
Chase made great strides and one day sold a picture
for $10 which went far toward convincing his father
that his son’s talent might not be a wholly useless one. </p>

<p>* * * * * * * * </p>

<p>Young William’s teacher Mr. Hayes soon told the father
that his pupil had learned all that he could teach
him and urged him to send his on to New York. So at
20 years of age in 1869 young Mr. Chase’s dream was realized and
he went to New York to study art. Armed with some of his
studies he proceeded directly to the studio of J. O. Eaton. The latter
was just leaving for a trip to Europe and refused to
have any thing to do with the young student. After
seeing his work, however, he turned over to Chase
the keys of his studio and told him to take possession
until his return. Chase worked in the studio and also in
the classes at the Academy of Design. For two years he studied
with Eaton and in the second year had a studio of his own
in the YMCA building – only two block from the studio where he
last worked before his death and just a short distance from final home where he
lived for over twenty years. </p>

<p>At this time at the age of 22 Chase exhibited his first pictures, a portrait and a “still
life” of grapes and plums. The latter picture he himself described later
as having “every grape polished and reflecting surrounding objects,”
a thing which I have known him to call “Terrible” – “horrible”! Because
his work was like all the other work being done at that time, it
did not attract especial attention. It was the “Victorian Age” when
weak “prettiness” reigned and the work of the Hudson River School
hung in the homes of the wealthy New Yorkers. Boston was
more advanced [and] fortunate as William Morris Hunt was introducing the work of the Barbizon school of
    Paris, France, there – but in those days it was a long ways from Boston to New York!</p>

<p>[Editor’s Note: The Barbizon paintings in the collection of the Hallie Ford Museum of Art are on view in the nearby Sponenburgh Gallery.]</p>

<p>At this time Chase’s family moved to St. Louis, so
William Merritt soon followed to take up his profession there.
In a very short time after arriving he saw some studies
by Mulvany, painted in Germany. These were shown at the
William Pattison Studio, which studio Chase shared with the
owner. Immediately Chase began to plan for study abroad . . . .</p>

<p>Four of Chase’s friends in St. Louis presented him with
a purse large enough for a long stay in Germany so in 1872 at 23
years of age he went to Munich and studied there for six years – at the Academy –
under Wagner and [Karl Theodor] von Piloty and others but was most influenced by the work of Wilhelm Leibl. The bargain was to paint each of his six benefactors a picture. </p>

<p>Frank Duveneck, Chase’s life long friend, had gone to
Munich two years previously. He was there when Chase arrived but
had to leave for a few month’s trip soon after. When he returned
he found that Chase had made such swift progress that
Chase and Frank Currier (another great friend of Mr. Chase’s and his roommate) were
then considered the most talented of the Munich students.</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * *
Chase . . . received the invitation [to teach at the Art Students League]
while at Venice in 1878 and probably would have refused it doubting his ability
to teach had not his friends urged him “just to try it.”</p>

<p>* * * * * * * *
It was my good fortune to study for three years at the Art Students League of New York, under Mr. Chase. Also six years later, while in New York for a
several weeks [at a time] I studied at the New York School of Art [periodically for]
two years (1896-1898). [This school was] founded by Chase and often called the Chase school of Art.  At the A.S.L. I took these two pictures of Mr. Chase
(and our still-life painting class) – we usually had a few men
in the class, but they evidently made their escape
before I took the pictures.</p>

<p>[Editor’s Note: One of Wiggins’s photographs of Chase’s class at the Art Students League is on view in this gallery.] </p>

<p>On rare occasions Mr. Chase would take his classes to the Metropolitan Museum
where he would talk to us on the finest work there—usually, Rembrandt or Frans Hals. He most despised and wouldn’t look at work by [William-Adolphe] Bouguereau and other artists who rounded everything out to a finish and painted in great detail. He may
never have said so in words, but his expression told the a tale wherever he was forced to notice one of these works.   </p>

<p>Chase had reception days at his famous 10th Street studio
and always welcomed his pupils there. Let us visit
that studio for a few minutes and meet Mr. Chase
there and hear him talk. Of course we use the great
knocker on the door and immediately it is opened
by an assistant, usually a private pupil. The polite
words we intend to say are almost frightened away
by the sound of sweet chords of music close by – as the
door closes we glance at it and see a splendid
zither hung there on with weights suspended by cords
sticking the strings. As the music grows fainter Mr.
Chase hastens forward to greet us. He was always a most
delightful host. The freedom of his studios is extended
to us, so we will glance about the rooms and alter
hear him talk when the crowd gathers.</p>

<p>A studio more than any other room reflects the character
of its owner. Mr. Chase was a connoisseur and
collector. Therefore his studios were filled with
pictures and beautiful and rare objects . . . . Turning to the
studios of Mr. Chase’s we observe that the keynote is
richness – it looks just like his wonderful still-life
paintings – like his palette. He used to say to us,
“clean your palette,” your painting will always look
like your palette.” Rich beautiful draperies hang
everywhere, with wonderful bits of copper and brass
gleaning in out of the way corners. Yonder is the
model stand, behind it a richly embroidered Chinese
screen with a dim colored old velvet thrown carelessly
across it. The predominating color is rose, like that of an oriental rug.  </p>

<p>There stands an old carved cupboard on
which are beautiful Korean bowls.  Interesting and valuable pieces of furniture [are] everywhere – with rich rugs and draperies. Here is an Italian
statuette, there hanging oriental lamps and also copper in abundance. High up on one wall is a mounted bird, a flamingo – under which [Carmencita] posed; farther on [are] Japanese lacquers,
    brass from Russia and Spain, a Buddha is in a passageway, on one wall an old Italian altarpiece, and hanging there, on the a walls a number a masterpiece of masterpieces
    in oils, probably a [Antoine] Vollon as Chase was fond of his still-life’s.    </p>

<p>[Editor’s Note: Myra Wiggins followed her mentor’s example by maintaining richly appointed studios filled with souvenirs of trips, family heirlooms, and artworks.  Her painting of her studio in Toppenish,
    Washington, is on view on the wall just outside this gallery.] </p>

<p>In a quiet corner is a small interesting picture and as we lean
forward to read the artist’s name Mr. Chase informs
us that he bought it, for its Art and not its name.
He was always doing this, buying good things
of unknown artists and so often called the attention
of the artworld to their works. As we had hoped —
Mr. Chase is giving an Art talk so let us listen.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase had an open mind for all the schools of art; but
he had no sympathy with the so-called futurist or cubist school, which was
flourishing at time of his death.
Chase did not claim that American Art was superior to any other
but he felt that it should be different from any
other in look and character. . . . . Mr. Chase considered Whistler
one of the greatest men of the last century.  Of the present
day artists he mentions, Sargent, Weir, Wiles, Homer,
Ryder, Henri, Glackens and Monet. The latter is an impressionist
and all are varied temperaments but according to
Mr. Chase that makes no difference, just so the artist
registers the ideals of his country.   </p>

<p>He points to the simple portraits of Franz Hals in Haarlem and says
they are “the greatest monument that exists to the manhood
and womanhood of the Dutch people at one of the greatest
periods of its history” gone for 300 years yet living to-day.
Before leaving the studio of course someone asks Mr.
Chase which one of his works he considers his masterpiece
and this is characteristic answer: “It is that one”
pointing to a perfectly blank canvas beautifully framed
hanging high on the wall. “Yes that is my best work.
I have painted on it thousands of times, and I know
that I am getting on with my art, because each
year I paint a better picture there. Not that I shall
ever actually touch a brush to canvas. It is for the
picture that I paint in my mind, for the ideals
toward which my actual works are directed. I am sorry
I cannot show you that picture quite as I see it;
I am always trying, but it keeps ahead of me the
more I advance and must remain something that
no one can see but myself — The full measure of
what my years as a painter, have led me to
realize, of life and nature and art.”</p>

<p>* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Before reviewing some of Mr. Chase’s own work
let us visit one of his classes. Criticism day, of
course – which came twice week at the Art
Students League N.Y. However we painted every
day in the week except Sunday and showed
Mr. Chase all our work – if we dared. We never
could get so used to his coming but that our
hearts would beat fast and our hands hold shaky
brushes; not that we were afraid of him personally
but of his criticisms. Here is a girl near the door
painting still-life. Mr. Chase gives one glance at her
canvas and then turns to her and gives her a
searching look. I always thought he gave this look to see
just how much adverse criticism the pupil could
stand, for he was so kind-hearted — but just, “O what
a pity” he tells this girl, “You have made your study
like skimmed when it should be cream – just
see the richness of the copper against that back-ground
yonder.  No wonder your highlight doesn’t shine, you haven’t
the contrasts.” To the next student he says, snapping
his fingers, (always a good sign.) “Ah, isn’t that a
delightful bit – so frankly painted! But why this
muddy foreground” – glancing at the palette held in
a trembling hand – “Of course – clean your palette.” </p>

<p>He then reaches out a long arm and touches with his
finger a new pupil, who is industriously working
but frightened almost out of his senses, as Chase
says in a loud stage whisper – “Don’t squint” – “Open
your eyes and look at it.” We all smile in sympathy
for we have all had the same thing happen to us,
since most of our instructors in drawing had taught us to
“squint” at our work study and we still do. At the next easel he says, “Tell
the truth at once – don’t ‘wiggle’ and ‘putter’ – put strength into
your work – those curves are weak, compose them of
angles then you will have both beauty and strength,
paint at arm’s length.   </p>

<p>Now he is coming toward me.
What will he say? I have cleaned my palette and done
everything I can think of to please him. But I stand timid
and trembling as he says – “You are taking it to seriously
— play with it, play with it!” – and he seizes one of my
large brushes, fills it with paint, waves it in the
air and paints a few treasured strokes – and
(this is the study) – one of my early ones – (show study) - all “brass
sauce” but I wasn’t guilty of putting that background
up or arranging the study. Of course I pretended
to go on with it – but do you think I could touch it
after Mr. Chase had left his mark there? Never.    </p>

<p>And so he proceeds, telling this one that she
needs a “fresh eye,” to go out in the hall or even
clear out of doors to get it. To another he says
“Keep it back – never let anything in your painting
jump out of the frame.” “Be carefully careless,
if you don’t succeed to-day – there is always to-morrow
“Consult an occulist” would be Mr. Chase’s advice
to a student who was painting with very bad color,
especially if that student remarked – “I see it that way”
Once a pupil painting very badly, interrupted Mr.
Chase and sneeringly asked – “Is there something the
matter with my eyes?” Mr. Chase adjusted his glasses
gave him a searching look and said – “I think not, I think
not, in your case sir, the trouble is a little higher up.”</p>

<p>One student dares to ask Mr. Chase how to paint so and so,
and he answers – “I don’t know – I cant tell you – You’ll
have to discover that for yourself.” It’s your problem”
he often told us. </p>

<p>* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>One day I met my Waterloo or something else
but it was one of the best things
that ever happened to me. We had a fine old man
for a model that week and I had painted what every
student in the room and the model also had declared was a wonderful
portrait of him – they crowded about me and predicted
that I would get an excellent criticism from Chase.
I myself however had secret misgivings so I was not
surprised, although very pained to hear him say,
(after he had given me a searching but most sympathetic
look) “Oh! Madam, I beg of you to destroy it – and forget that
you ever painted like that – you will not regret it – it
is too pretty, too perfect.” And it was, the wrinkles, the hair
the flesh, was just as it was in nature, and that wasn’t
art. It was weak and he was always trying to teach us
to put strength into our work and to suggest the truth,
leaving the beholders imagination to perfect it. We were
perfectly happy when Mr. Chase smiled and snapped his
finger in delight over something in our study and those
studies are treasured to this day. </p>
