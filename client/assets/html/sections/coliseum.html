<p>…we drove to the Roman Forum, a place full of interest, especially on account of the recent excavations within the last two years. The work is going on all the time;
    modern churches and houses are being torn down. The old Christian church dating from the fifth century, recently excavated, contained mural decorations
    of the crucifixion so well preserved; it also showed the altar and baptistry. I planted my camera on a rock to take a time picture of it when a guard came
    running up to me telling me by signs that it was forbidden to take pictures of the place. I caught up with the guide and asked him about it, and he said that
    it was only the new excavations of which photographers were forbidden to take pictures. I took snap shots of some of the fine old columns and arches which are
    standing among the ruins. The Coliseum is quite near the Forum so we went there next. It is a grand old ruin; have seen it so many times in pictures but
    it will always mean so much more to me now. We saw where the animals were kept, where they fought and devoured the Christians, where the Emperor and his
    followers sat, the subterranean passage to Nero’s palace, the caves where the Christians were kept, and many other interesting things in connection
    with the old ruins.</p>
