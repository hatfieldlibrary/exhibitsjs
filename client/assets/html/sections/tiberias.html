<p>...Soon after the sun set over the hills at Nazareth, we went to bed, for we had to prepare again for an early start the next morning. We had another lovely dawn and we rode
    ver the beautiful mountains and plains until about 11 o’clock, when we halted on the top of one of the high mountains overlooking the sea of Galilee. On the west side and
    right at our feet, at the water’s edge, lay Tiberias. We all climbed out and gathered about our guide while he pointed out to us the interesting sights. Close to our left
    was the mount of Beatitudes, a little further on all that is left of the city of Bethsaida, still further on also at the water’s edge of the site of Capernaum, marked by a
    monastery, then just by the side of it the Jordan emptying into the sea. Back of it was the beautiful snow-capped Mt. Hermon, the supposed mount of transfiguration.
    Across the lake from us, here about seven miles wide, is the country of the Gadarenes (Mark 5, 1:20). It is very noticeable as it seems to slope right into the sea.
    On the mountain on which we were standing grew only grass, flowers and low thorn bushes, the latter having both dry thorns and green leaves. We hurried on down to Teberias,
    where we met crowd No. 5 preparing to return to Nazareth. AS soon as they were off we had luncheon, then, leaving Mrs. Park taking a nap, I took my camera and went out at the
    side of the hotel to take a picture of an old arch in ruins. The sun was not out just then, so I engaged in conversation with some native boys. Of course, it was all sign
    language at first, then I began to teach them the name of colors in English. This pleased them so much, and also the by-standers, that I soon had six or eight Arab men
    in my audience, and when I spied a cat and meowed like one, their delight knew no bounds and one old Arab insisted upon showing me through the old mosque near by.
    I refused and went back to the hotel, but, before this, three Turkish women, closely veiled, came up to me, and one of them caressed my cheeks wither hand and smoothed
    the back of my hair, (the wrong way), all of which I endured with a smile. She invited me by signs to her house but I was forced to refuse. When I reached the front
    door of the hotel it was locked, so I pounded and waited but no one came; finally one of the cooks came in from the kitchen,  which was in the back yard, and I called
    to him and he let me in. I found Mrs. Park asleep and such a silence reigned in the hotel that I became alarmed with the thought that they had all gone in the boars on
    the sea of Galilee. I soon found out by signs from one of the servants that such was the case, and calling Mrs. Park, I ran with cloaks and wraps on my arm, in the direction
    of the sea, down some dirty narrow streets where I had never been, asking one woman on the way if I was going in the right direction. Well, I came suddenly upon the shore
    just as Mr. Hornstein was pushing out from shore in the last boat. I “yelled,” you may believe, and he waited till Mrs. Park arrived, puffing and steaming, for it was a
    warm day. …In my search for something to take with the sea, to make a picture of it interesting, a little way up the beach I spied a kind of screen of dried palms, and
    made for it with my camera. As I drew quite near I saw signs which made me hesitate and I suddenly called out: “Oh, is that a bath house? I was going over to the other
    side to take a picture of it;” then as I saw more “bare” signs , a voice from behind the screen called out: “Oh no, don’t take it just now, please.”   </p>
