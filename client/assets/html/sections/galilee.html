<p>…Beautiful flowers lined all our way and I might say here that I had more than my share of them, with four men to pick them for me, for our drivers was not going to be outdone and every
little while he would present “Madame” with a bouquet. I wore them in my hat, on my coat, and decorated the hack with them. We had not gone far till we saw one of those old primitive plows
made of a crooked stick and pulled by two oxen. I was not going to miss my chance, so I grabbed my camera, sprang out of the hack while it was going, ran to the field, took a snap shot and
was returning on the run, when the man at the plow took after me fro “Back-sheesh.” Well I have never heard the last of it, for, of course, the whole cavalcade witnessed it and several of
them said that they would give a good deal for a picture of me with my coat flying out behind and the man after me. I returned to the hack, jumped in while it was going, as I did not want
to stop the whole line, and was greeted by one of my friends thus: “Well you’re a brick, you’re worth a whole dozen of them.”  … We descended into a valley and then climbed to a very high
mountain where all stopped and the guide pointed out the interesting sites to us. I can never describe the view from this point, the beauty of the cultivated valleys and
the barren mountains. That beautiful view away over in Polk county (Oregon) from the top of the hill, comes the nearest to it of anything I have ever seen, but, of course,
it has not the historic interest…  </p>
