<p>Vernor Martin Sackett, the man who took these photographs, was born in 1898 in Jefferson, Oregon. He registered to
    serve in World War I while he was in high school and served in Germany between 1918 and 1919. In the fall of 1919,
    he was enrolled at Willamette as a sophomore, joining his younger brother Sheldon. While at Willamette, Vernor was
    a member of the Websterian society, the Collegian, and the Glee club. Vernor served as the staff photographer for
    the Wallulah as a junior, for which many of his photographs were taken. Vernor married Mary Notson, who graduated
    from Willamette a year before him. After Vernor graduated in 1922, he and Mary settled in Salem, where Vernor worked
    as an insurance salesman among other jobs. They lived in the same house near Bush's Pasture Park throughout their
    lives, never having any children. Vernor died in Salem in 1965. He never received any professional recognition for his
    photography. </p>
