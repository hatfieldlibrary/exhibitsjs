<p> In 1890, Fred Brown Sackett and Hattie Ermina Schenck moved to Oregon from New York. Both Fred and Hattie were born
    in New York and were married there in 1887. They came to Oregon to farm, but quickly moved on to conducting other
    mercantile businesses. For at least a decade, the Sacketts moved around Oregon before settling in Sheridan. By that
    time, Fred had become involved with the republican party, which eventually named him a judge for Yamhill County. Vernor
was the middle child of the family. He had two brothers, Leland, the eldest, and Sheldon, the youngest. Fred and Hattie
had three more children, but two died in infancy and one died as a child.</p>
