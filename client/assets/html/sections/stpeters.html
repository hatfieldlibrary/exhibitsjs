<p>…We then drove to the Vatican, where the Pope’s residence was pointed out to us, and then we visited there the Sistine Chapel, the Museum of Sculpture, and room after room containing
    fine old paintings, one of which was Raphael’s “Transfiguration.” But the Sistine Chapel was the greatest attraction to me; it contains Michael Angelo’s “Last Judgment” –
    the whole of the end wall, and his wonderful ceiling. There are mural decorations by other artists on the side walls but while the guide was explaining them I turned
    again to the former, and all too soon he called us away. The library was not open wile we were in Rome. I was so sorry for I did want to see it.</p>
