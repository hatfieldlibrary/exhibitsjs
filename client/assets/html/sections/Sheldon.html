<p> Sheldon Frederick Sackett is the youngest son of the Sackett family. He was born in 1902 in Jefferson, Oregon.
    In 1918, he began studying at Willamette. Sheldon is described as having "brilliance that bordered on genius."
    As a child, he was passed through elementary and high school quickly, beginning his collegiate career at sixteen years
    old. Like his older brother Vernor, Sheldon was a member of the fraternity Sigma Tau, the Websterian society. He was
    also a phenomenal debator, winning many competitions with his debating partner Robert Notson, who was Vernor's
    brother-in-law. Sheldon also worked his way up the Collegian staff positions, beginning as a mail clerk as a sophomore
    and ending as the editor of the paper in his senior year, while also graduating with some of the highest grades in
    his class. Sheldon married Sadie Pratt, another Willamette graduate, in 1925. They had one child together, but the
    marriage ended in divorce five years later. Sheldon would go on to marry three more times, divorce twice more, and
    have three more children. Sheldon's passion was in journalism, and he became a very successful newspaper and media publisher
    on the west coast. At one point in his life, Sheldon had about $30 million to his name. In 1968, he died of pancreatic
    cancer in California. </p>
