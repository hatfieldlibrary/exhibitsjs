<p>...We left Constantinople early the next morning instead of 12 o’clock and we were all out on deck as we steamed past the interesting sites up into the Black sea. At the narrowest
part of the Bosphorus are the ruins of a beautiful old fort with towers and turrets. It was built by the first Sultan who defended the Bosphorus. There also was where Darius
had his fleet, if I am not mistaken. Constantinople, too, looked beautiful in the hazy morning light and I tried to take a few snap shots of it, but it was a little dark I think. </p>

<p>In Constantinople we had our first rain, but it was very little. </p>

<p>The next morning we were called at 5:20 o’clock; had breakfast at 6, but did not land at Smyrna till about 8 o’clock. It was raining and everybody looked discouraged, especially
those holding Ephesus side trip tickets, as we had been warned the evening before by Mr. Warren that it would be a very hard trip; about five miles of walking after we reached there,
and the program had been changed so that the Ephesus crowd would miss all of Smyrna except about one or two hours on their return, as we sailed the same night. Some sold their Ephesus
tickets cheap; others stayed home and couldn’t sell theirs, but Mrs. Park and I, with two or three hundred others, decided to “do or die” and how glad we were, for Smyrna proved to be
uninteresting. But Ephesus; it is grand! and we did not take the long walk out to the temple either, but we walked about half a mile through the most interesting old ruins all about us,
to the ruins of St. John’s church where St. John preached for three years – the church mentioned in Revelation. There is really nothing of it remaining except the fallen walls with
decorations and inscriptions on some of the pieces, but the great arched gate leading to it is very beautiful and interesting. A caravan of camels was in Ephesus that day and I got some
of them to pose for me. I wandered off into a field where they were – set my camera on a tripod (for it was a dark day) and took portraits of the camels. Mrs. Park said they actually
looked like they were posing for me. Twice they thought that I got a little too close, and took after me. Of course I yelled, grabbed my camera and ran, greatly to the amusement of the
group of Arabs, the owners of the animals; they laughed and laughed; they though it was so funny, but it was no fun running, for the groups was covered completely with squares of marble
and stone.  </p>
