<p>The eldest son of the Sackett family, Leland Russell was born in 1890 in Corvallis, Oregon. He attended Willamette between 1914 and 1915. While he
never graduated, he did have a substantial effect on the university. In 1914, Leland wrote a letter to the editor of the
Collegian, advocating for a student government. By the next year, an early version of the Associated Students of
Willamette University was established, and Leland was on the executive committee. He was also the manager of the track
and basketball teams, vice president of the Websterian society, and associate editor of athletics for the Collegian. At
the time Leland was drafted to serve in World War I in 1917, he was working for the Southern Pacific Railroad. When he returned from
the war, he married Fannie McKennon, who graduated from Willamette in 1918. They had three children together and
lived in Sheridan, Oregon where Leland owned an insurance company with his brother-in-law. He died in 1986.</p>
